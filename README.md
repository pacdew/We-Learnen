# We-Learnen
This repository is created to develop my skills alongside the guidelines of the csusb CSE 405 class.
This git hub repository is new to me but does seem very useful!

4/24/2020 - Java != Javascript
  - Using atom I have learned a portion of javascript. (which is much more simplified code than I have ever worked with)
  - By linking atom with github I am able to keep my repository up to date as I work and discovery mistakes I have/had made.

5/1/2020 - nodejs (atom doesn't fill in the possible functions ): )
  - learned some basics about nodejs and how it is different to running javascript within a browser
  - https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/ is a great reference to many functions that I can use and how I can use them
  - I plan to keep on working on nodejs with html, javasctipt, and node integration.
