# We-Learnen
This repository is created to develop my skills alongside the guidelines of the csusb CSE 405 class.
This git hub repository is new to me but does seem very useful!

4/24/2020 - Java != Javascript
  - Using atom I have learned a portion of javascript. (which is much more simplified code than I have ever worked with)
  - By linking atom with github I am able to keep my repository up to date as I work and discovery mistakes I have/had made.

5/1/2020 - nodejs (atom doesn't fill in the possible functions ): )
  - learned some basics about nodejs and how it is different to running javascript within a browser
  - https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/ is a great reference to many functions that I can use and how I can use them
  - I plan to keep on working on nodejs with html, javasctipt, and node integration.

5/7/2020 - inspiration
  - I have an idea of what to make with the application, I'm going to make a shopping list that can be shared between accounts.
  - I mostly worked on javascript within html pages using node. Tried to create a basic set of pages that can be accessed each other.
  - I definatly need to work with firebase and build up more of an application.
  - Otherwise i have been quite busy with other assignments. I do have plans to dedicate more time to this application.

5/15/2020 - More dedicated time
  - Spent some time setting up firebase as shown in the lecture, still have much more to do.
  - set up slight functionality within the firebase application.
  - will work on actual user identification and login functionality.
  - will work on being able to upload lists and the ability to edit them if user is correctly validated
